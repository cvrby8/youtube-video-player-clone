# YouTube Video Player Clone â€” Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS Video Player ðŸŽ¬

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-%20Download-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/cvrby8/youtube-video-player-clone/releases)

A clean, responsive YouTube-style video player built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It implements core player controls and UI patterns you find on modern video sites. This project exists as a learning exercise based on a Web Dev Simplified tutorial and as a reference for DOM-driven UI and HTML5 video APIs.

Live demo and packaged releases are available. Visit the Releases page and download the release asset file; the file needs to be downloaded and executed. See the Releases section below for the link and steps.

Installation
- Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/cvrby8/youtube-video-player-clone.git
- Or download a release from the Releases page and extract it. The release asset file needs to be downloaded and executed.
- Open index.html in your browser or run a local server.

Quick start
- Static open:
  1. Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Local server (recommended for PiP and some APIs):
  - Python 3:
    python3 -m http.server 8000
  - Node (http-server):
    npx http-server -c-1
  - Then open http://localhost:8000

Usage and controls
- Click the play/pause button or the video to toggle play.
- Drag or click the seek bar to change the current time.
- Use the volume slider to set volume. Click the speaker icon to mute/unmute.
- Click the fullscreen button to enter Fullscreen API mode.
- Click the theater mode button to expand the player and dim the page.
- Click the mini player (PiP) button to open a floating video window.
- Hover over the controls to show them; move the mouse away to hide them after a short delay.

Keyboard shortcuts
- Space or K: Toggle play/pause
- J: Rewind 10 seconds
- L: Forward 10 seconds
- Arrow Left / Right: Seek -5 / +5 seconds
- Arrow Up / Down: Volume +5% / -5%
- M: Mute / unmute
- F: Toggle fullscreen
- T: Toggle theater mode
- I: Enter picture-in-picture (PiP)
- 0-9: Seek to 0% - 90% of duration (0 = start, 9 = 90%)

Code structure
- index.html â€” main markup and player structure
- styles/
  - main.css â€” layout, transitions, responsive styles
  - icons.css â€” SVG sprite and icon styles
- src/
  - player.js â€” player logic, event listeners, DOM updates
  - shortcuts.js â€” keyboard handler and mapping
  - controls.js â€” individual control modules (volume, seek, fullscreen)
- assets/
  - icons.svg â€” SVG icons for controls
  - sample-videos/ â€” sample video files for local testing
- README.md â€” this file

Key APIs and techniques used
- HTML5 <video> element
  - currentTime, duration, buffered, paused, volume, muted
- Fullscreen API
  - element.requestFullscreen(), document.exitFullscreen()
  - fullscreenchange event
- Picture-in-Picture API
  - video.requestPictureInPicture(), document.pictureInPictureElement
- MediaSession API (optional)
  - navigator.mediaSession to set metadata and action handlers
- Event listeners
  - pointer events for seeking, input events for range controls
- CSS
  - Flexbox for layout
  - CSS transitions for smooth seek bar and control fading
  - CSS variables for theme options

Accessibility and responsive notes
- Use semantic buttons with aria-label attributes for all controls.
- Provide keyboard focus states for every interactive control.
- Use role="region" and aria-label on the player wrapper for screen reader context.
- Add captions or text tracks for accessibility testing. The player supports loading WebVTT files.
- The layout scales from mobile to desktop. Controls rearrange using CSS media queries.

Development tips
- Debugging video events:
  - Use console logs on timeupdate, seeked, and progress to inspect timing and buffered ranges.
- Volume and mute:
  - Keep volume range 0.0 to 1.0. Save last volume value for mute toggle.
- Seek precision:
  - Update the seek preview when scrubbing using pointermove. Clamp values between 0 and duration.
- Fullscreen quirks:
  - Some browsers restrict autoplay and PiP in cross-origin iframes. Test locally.
- Picture-in-Picture:
  - PiP requires user gesture in some browsers. Tie request to a click handler.

Customization
- Swap icons via the SVG sprite in assets/icons.svg.
- Change color theme via CSS variables in main.css.
- Add playback rate control by exposing video.playbackRate and a menu.

Testing checklist
- Play/pause works by click and keyboard.
- Seek bar reflects current time and buffered ranges.
- Volume slider updates audio and UI icons.
- Fullscreen and theater mode toggle layout and body styles.
- PiP opens a floating window on supported browsers.
- Keyboard shortcuts fire regardless of focus on the player container (but not while typing in an input).
